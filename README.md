# Edge-Cloud Computing for Task Offloading and Service Caching

  ## Introduction
Edge-cloud computing efficiently reduces latency in mobile cloud computing by placing resources closer to end devices. This project addresses **task offloading and service caching** by formulating a constrained discrete optimization problem and proposing **LMPSO**, a hybrid heuristic method using **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** with **Lévy flight movement** to enhance solution diversity.

LMPSO follows a **three-stage heuristic task offloading strategy**:
1. **Utilizing cloud resources** for efficiency.
2. **Allocating edge resources** for latency-sensitive tasks.
3. **Re-offloading tasks** to optimize execution.

Experiments show that LMPSO achieves **up to 156% better user satisfaction, 57.9% higher resource efficiency, and 155% greater processing efficiency** compared to other methods.

## Objectives of the Project
- Develop an efficient **task offloading and service caching** mechanism in edge-cloud computing.
- Optimize **resource utilization** while reducing latency.
- Implement a **hybrid heuristic approach (LMPSO)** using Particle Swarm Optimization and Lévy flight movement.
- Design a **three-stage heuristic task offloading strategy**.
- Compare LMPSO with other heuristic and meta-heuristic methods to validate performance improvements.
